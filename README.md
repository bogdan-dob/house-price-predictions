# House Prices

This project uses a dataset with Boston house prices from Kaggle and was inspired by the CodeX article entitled "House Price Prediction With Machine Learning in Python". It implements a data pipeline of first loading the dataset, cleaning and pre-processing it, then fitting a model to it, and finally testing the model's performance using evaluation metrics.
